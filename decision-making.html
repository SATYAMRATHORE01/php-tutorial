        <p class="lead">In PHP, decision making is like making choices in real life. It allows your program to do different things based on different conditions. Here's how it works:</p>

        <div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">The "if" Statement</h4>
            <p>The "if" statement lets you ask a question and take different actions based on the answer. It's like deciding to go out if the weather is sunny:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $weather = "sunny";
    if ($weather == "sunny") {
        echo "Let's go out!";
    } else {
        echo "Stay indoors.";
    }
?&gt;</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">The "else if" Statement</h4>
            <p>If you have more than two options, you can use "else if" to make more decisions. For example, choosing an outfit based on the weather:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $weather = "rainy";
    if ($weather == "sunny") {
        echo "Wear shorts.";
    } else if ($weather == "rainy") {
        echo "Grab an umbrella.";
    } else {
        echo "Decide what to wear.";
    }
?&gt;</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">The "switch" Statement</h4>
            <p>When you have many options, a "switch" statement helps you choose between them. Think of it as picking a drink from a menu:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;?php
    $choice = "coffee";
    switch ($choice) {
        case "tea":
            echo "Tea is a good choice.";
            break;
        case "coffee":
            echo "Coffee is a classic.";
            break;
        default:
            echo "Make your selection.";
    }
?&gt;</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p class="lead">Decision making in PHP allows your program to act intelligently based on different conditions, just like how you make choices in everyday life. It's a way to add flexibility to your code.</p>
