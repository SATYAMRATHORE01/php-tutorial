    </header>
    <main class="container mt-5">
        <p class="lead">Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored at the client side, specifically in a user's web browser. They are a common mechanism for web applications to store and retrieve information between HTTP requests and sessions. Let's delve into the details of cookie storage:</p>

        <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
            <strong>Creating a Cookie:</strong>
            <p>When a web server sends an HTTP response, it can include one or more cookies in the response headers. A cookie typically consists of a name, a value, and optional attributes like an expiration date and domain.</p>
            <pre><code>
Set-Cookie: username=John; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 2030 00:00:00 GMT; path=/
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
            <strong>Storage Location:</strong>
            <p>Cookies are stored on the client side, usually in a file on the user's computer. In most browsers, these files are called "cookies.txt" or "cookies.sqlite." The specific location may vary depending on the browser and operating system.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
            <strong>Accessing Cookies:</strong>
            <p>Browsers provide a JavaScript API for accessing and manipulating cookies. You can use JavaScript to read, write, and delete cookies on the client side. The <code>document.cookie</code> property is commonly used for this purpose.</p>
            <pre><code>
// Read a cookie
var username = document.cookie;

// Write a cookie
document.cookie = "username=John; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 2030 00:00:00 GMT; path=/";
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
            <strong>Cookie Expiration:</strong>
            <p>Cookies can have an optional expiration date, after which they will be automatically deleted by the browser. This is useful for creating persistent or temporary data storage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
            <strong>Security Considerations:</strong>
            <p>It's important to be cautious when working with cookies to prevent security vulnerabilities. Secure and HttpOnly flags can be used to enhance cookie security.</p>
